This is my exes and Ohs Game made in the Processing IDE.
The game itself was originally developed in C++ to be played in the terminal. This meant that all the graphics were custom ASCII art that looked something like this:

As seen from this excerpt, the player would select if they wanted to play a friend or a bot by inputting the player count. The player(s) choose where to place an X or an O by entering the number for the cell they wanted.
This is cool and, at the time, was the best I was capable of. BUT then I was introduced to Processing. Processing is a free graphics library and IDE. 
Basically it was presented to me as a software for programming Graphical User interfaces using what is essentially C++.

This meant I could now try and make a version of the X and O (from now TicTacToe for simplicity) which used mouse Clicks for placing objects.
So long stroy short, I did! I also used the website https://www.pixilart.com/ to make my own custom graphics for the game.

I hope to update this and the rest of my projects here soon.
